#Task Description : This HTML document creates a webpage for a fictional company named "SOLARA IT SOFTWARE COMPANY". 
		    It includes sections for the company's leadership/management team, development team, and sales and 
		    marketing team, with each team member represented by a card containing their image, name, and role 
		    within the company. Additionally, there are styling elements for various components such as headers, paragraphs, and team member cards.
#Steps Taken :The steps taken to create this responsive company member team page:

	1. **HTML Structure**:
		- Defined the basic HTML structure with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
		- Added meta tags for character set and viewport settings to ensure proper rendering across devices.
		- Provided a title for the page within the `<title>` tag.

	2. **Global Styles**:
		- Reset the default margin, padding, and box-sizing using the universal selector `*`.
		- Styled the body with a specific font family, background color, padding, and box shadow.
		- Styled the `.container` class to set a maximum width, background color, border, margin, and box-shadow for the main content container.

	3. **Header Styles**:
		- Centered the content within the header using `text-align: center`.
		- Styled the `<h1>` tag within the header with specific font size, margin, padding, color, background color, border-radius, and display as inline-block.

	4. **Introduction Section Styles**:
		- Added a welcome paragraph (`<p>`) with a unique class `.para` to define margin, font size, and font weight.
		- Included a decorative horizontal line using a paragraph element with class `.p`.

	5. **Team Section Styles**:
		- Centered the heading "Meet Our Team" using margin and padding.
		- Set up individual headers for each team section ("Leadership/Management Team", "Development Team", "Sales and Marketing Team").

	6. **Team Member Card Styles**:
		- Utilized Flexbox (`display: flex`) to create a responsive layout for team members.
		- Styled individual team member cards with appropriate width, margin, padding, text-align, font sizes, and colors.
		- Adjusted the width and border-radius of images to maintain consistency in the appearance of team member photos.

	7. **Repeating Team Member Cards**:
		- Duplicated the team member card structure for each team member, replacing placeholder names and roles with actual information.
		- Inserted `<img>` tags with URLs of placeholder images for team members.
		- Added `<h3>` and `<h4>` tags for team member names and positions, respectively.

	8. **Additional Styling**:
		- Added two additional `<div>` elements with classes `.box` and `.box1` for decorative purposes, positioned them using absolute positioning and specified styles for width, height, background color, margin, and alignment.

	9. **Adding Additional Information**:
		-Added to Company Name, Founders Names and Employees Names.

	These steps collectively create a responsive company member team page with a structured layout, styled headers, introduction section, team member cards, and additional decorative elements.
